# Filament: Fearless Hardware Design

Filament is a hardware description language (HDL) that uses a type system to specify and compose hardware pipelines.
Filament reasons about the *timing* of a design, allowing the compiler to automatically generate pipelined designs with little to no overhead.

Get started with Filament by reading the [tutorial](https://filamenthdl.com).

Filament's design is based on the paper ["Modular Hardware Design with Timeline Types"][filament-paper] although it has evolved significantly since then.
