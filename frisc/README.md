# `frisc`: A RISC-V Processor in Filament

`frisc` is an experimental, statically-scheduled [RISC-V processor][riscv] written in Filamebt that implements the base instruction set.
We're implementing simple 3-stage pipeline and after validating it, will work on more complex pipelines and instruction extensions.
