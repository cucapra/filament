JSON files don't like when you put comments there, so the test cases are explained here. 
The start of a new test case is indicated by the reset signal going high.
The way tests are verified now is that the output of the ALU is wired to the output of the CPU, so we can inspect that.

Test 1:
addi x1, x1, 6
addi x2, x1, 2
addi x2, 1

Test 2:
addi x7, x7, 16
addi x1, x1, 1
sll x7, x7, x1

Test 3:
addi x3, x3, 32
addi x19, x19, 2
sra x4, x3, x19

Test 4:
addi x3, x3, -64
addi x5, x5, 2
sra x4, x3, x5
