2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-15#1 Warning
Large hold violation  
There is a large clock skew of 1.312 ns between ready_in (clocked by clk) and alu_inst/adder/fifo_count_reg[1]/D (clocked by clk) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -1.259 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#2 Warning
Large hold violation  
There is a large clock skew of 1.312 ns between ready_in (clocked by clk) and alu_inst/adder/fifo_count_reg[2]/D (clocked by clk) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -1.279 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
Related violations: <none>
