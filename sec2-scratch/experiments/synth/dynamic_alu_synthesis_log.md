# Dynamic ALU Synthesis Experiment Log

## Design Overview
- **Module**: Dynamic ALU with latency-insensitive interface
- **Configuration**: 2-stage floating-point adder, 3-stage floating-point multiplier
- **Operations**: Add, Subtract, Multiply with ready-valid handshaking

## Synthesis Results

### Timing Analysis
- **Target Clock Period**: 7.0 ns (142.857 MHz)
- **Timing Status**: FAILED (meet_timing = 0)
- **Worst Slack**: 1.893 ns
- **Note**: Despite positive slack shown in timing report, synthrep indicates timing failure

### Resource Utilization (Post-Implementation)
- **LUTs**: 670 (0.95% utilization)
- **Registers**: 1,174 (0.83% utilization)
- **DSP Blocks**: 2 (0.56% utilization)
- **BRAM**: 0
- **Carry8**: 13 (0.15% utilization)

### Hierarchical Resource Breakdown
1. **Top Module (main)**: 670 LUTs, 1174 FFs, 2 DSPs
2. **Dynamic_ALU Instance**: 670 LUTs, 1174 FFs, 2 DSPs
   - **FP_Adder_LI_Wrapper**: 433 LUTs, 577 FFs, 0 DSPs
   - **FP_Mult_LI_Wrapper**: 237 LUTs, 597 FFs, 2 DSPs

### Critical Path Analysis
The critical path originates from:
- **Source**: `alu_inst/multiplier/output_valid_reg_reg/C`
- **Destination**: `alu_inst/multiplier/input_fifo_reg[4][10]/CE`
- **Total Delay**: 4.734 ns
  - Logic delay: 0.509 ns (10.75%)
  - Routing delay: 4.225 ns (89.25%)
- **Logic Levels**: 3 (LUT3, LUT5, LUT6)

### Key Observations

1. **Routing Dominance**: The critical path is heavily dominated by routing delay (89.25%), suggesting potential placement issues or long wire routes between the multiplier's output valid register and input FIFO control.

2. **Resource Efficiency**: The design uses minimal resources with only 2 DSP blocks for the floating-point multiplier, showing good synthesis optimization.

3. **Timing Contradiction**: There's a discrepancy between the timing report showing "MET" with positive slack and synthrep indicating failure. This needs investigation.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Pipeline Optimization**: 
   - Consider adding pipeline registers between the output valid logic and FIFO control signals
   - The path from `output_valid_reg` to `input_fifo` control suggests the ready-valid handshaking logic could benefit from additional pipelining

2. **Physical Constraints**:
   - Add placement constraints to keep the multiplier's control logic physically closer
   - Consider floorplanning to reduce routing delays

3. **Architecture Changes**:
   - Separate the FIFO control logic from the output valid path
   - Consider using dedicated control registers for FIFO enable signals

4. **Timing Investigation**:
   - Investigate why synthrep reports timing failure despite positive slack
   - Check if there are multi-cycle paths or false paths that need proper constraints
